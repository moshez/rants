Computers are Magic
===================

Does magic exist?
Are computers magic?
Good questions!

Magic: non-definitions
----------------------

Before explaining why computers are
"magic",
it is important to have a definition of
what magic is.
Computers exist.
If part of the definition of magic is
"something that does not exist",
computers are not magic.

For example,
if the definition of magic is
"something supernatural",
and
"something supernatural"
is
"outside the laws of physics",
and
"the laws of physics"
is defined as what is
*true*,
then of course magic is not real,
and then computers are not magic.
But this is kind of a weird way to define
"magic",
if you want to be able to ask whether
magic exists.

If the definition of magic includes
"nobody understands it",
then it depends on what
"understands it"
means.

The average wizard might just
a practitioner with little understanding
of the theory.
It would be weird,
though,
if magic was somehow
discovered by humans with a process
of complete,
unguided by theory,
of trial and error.
In many stories about magic,
the whole wizard community,
put together,
does understand magic well enough.

If your definition of magic is
"does not exist",
it excludes computers by definition.
If your definition of magic is
"all of humanity,
put together,
does not understand it",
it excludes many magic systems
in many fantasy stories.


Magic: commonalities
--------------------

Every fantasy universe's
magic works a little differently.
Calling all of them magic
means diving into the commonalities.

Like most human concepts,
it is unrealistic to expect a strict
definition.
The concept is explained with examples,
and some heuristics and guidelines.

* Special materials:
  many magical rituals require special
  materials,
  mixed in precise ways.
* Spells:
  many magical rituals involve
  specific long spells which must
  recited precisely as written.
  The smallest mistake can lead
  to anything from the spell not working
  to a complete disaster.
* Book-learning and practical training:
  wizards are usually trained with
  a combination of a lot of theoretical
  training and,
  on top of it,
  some sort of on the job training.
  Part of what novices learn is how to
  avoid seductive short-cuts
  that end in disasters.
* Hard to understand:
  Even high level practicioners
  will sometime not understand all
  the details of how magic works.
  "Usually,
  this is a good way for doing spells,
  but for spells that affect metals,
  this is the bad idea."
  
Not all of these are 
"required"
to for something to be
"magic".
But these criteria help decide if something
"feels like magic"

Computers
---------

Chips
^^^^^

The basic component of a computer chip
is a transistor.
Many transistors are made from silicon
(sand),
combined with Gallium arsenide
and Germanium.
These,
in term,
are made from Arsenic
(a poison)
and Gallium,
a metal with some weird properties.
Germanium
is another metal with weird properties.
The process is called
"doping",
and is extremely precise.

These transistors are connected with
barely-visible wiring made of gold,
set in intricate patterns.
A small mistake in these patterns
will often cause a computer chip
not to function at all.

Software
^^^^^^^^

A chip by itself is useless.
In order to use a chip,
it has to be fed a long stream
of meaningless symbols just
to start interacting with
the outside world.

Even those meaningless symbols
are not enough:
they just do something the initiates
call
"bootstrapping".
Another list of meaningless symbols,
this time usually produced by a ritual
called
"compiling"
from
long phrases in inhuman languages,
is needed to actually have
it interact with a human.

This is just for basic
human-computer
interactions.
In order to do things that are
really useful,
most people need to pay for custom
additions to do things
like
help file their taxes or
talk to their friends.

Even high-level initiates will often
choose to pay for a pre-written
addition,
though when pressed,
they will sometimes choose to
write something themselves in
their favorite inhuman language.
This quick and dirty addition
will be less polished,
potentially dangerous,
but will be suited to the special
needs of the practitioner.

While some practicioners share their
lore freely with the world,
many guard their secrets jealously.
Indeed,
some practicioners have been arrested
by police forces
sympathetic to the ones guarding secrets
for revealing the wrong secrets
at the wrong time.

Understanding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is probably no single human
alive that understands everything
about how a single computer works.
They would need to have solid grounding
in modern quantum mechanics,
modern computer engineering,
modern operating systems engineering,
computer graphic abstractions,
and more.

Most practicioners specialize in one
area,
and develop rough heuristics about the
rest.
When those heuristics break,
the results can sometimes be
`global disasters`_.

The
`alignment of the heavens`_
can
also sometimes wreak havoc on
otherwise carefully written
computer spells.
In recent times,
this is mostly mitigated by
`powerful, though costly, magical spells`_.

Conclusion
----------

If someone went back to
1850
and said that there will be
special things
that are made from
melted sand
and
precise amounts of poison mixed in,
inlaid in special patterns of gold,
and that when specially trained
practitioners,
who often do not understand how the
whole thing works,
can still create long phrases
in inhuman languages,
and if those are written correctly,
they will can do anything from
figure out if a person is in front of
them to help
calculate your taxes,
people will just stop them and say
"so, magic, right?"

If they went on to describe the failure
modes of computers,
people would be even more convinced.
A spell written incorrectly
can simply not function,
or can look like it functions
until the exact set of circumstances
appears
that will cause everything to
malfunction hilariously
or disasterously.
Some evil practicioners are trained
in figuring out the subtle flaws
in those long phrases,
so that they can cause them to
malfunction to their benefit.

There is no sense that an answer to
"are computers magic"
is
"no",
unless
"does not exist"
is part of the definition of magic.
There is nothing else that we
*define*
as fictional.
Why should magic be different?
