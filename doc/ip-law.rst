Intellectual Property Law
=========================

Dislaimers
----------

I am not a lawyer,
and this is not legal advice.
The subject covered here is not
"law"
but
"moral foundations of law",
part of the philosophy of ethics.

Also,
the takes here are very
"cold".
They have been explained before,
by others.

The rant is here so that I can avoid repeating it.
All mistakes are my responsibility.

Among the people who I have learned for are
Richard M. Stallman
and
Cory Doctorow.

Introduction
------------

Fundamentally,
IP law is a misnomer.
It is a collection of different laws
covering different things.
It is best understood as a collection of unrelated things.

All of these laws are designed as
*trade-offs*:
can we encourage maximum good
for the least cost?
One of the reasons they are highly contentious
is because shifting the trade-off
to have a different party incur the cost
is easy to argue for.

Trademark Law
-------------

Trademarks cover various things:
logos,
slogans,
words,
and icons.
There are also various forms of trademark
or trade symbol protection.

The
*original intent*
of trademark law
is as an
anti-consumer
fraud device.
The idea is that consumers should be able to trust
the source of the goods they acquire.

The simplest example is that of a logo.

Let's say I make tables.
I use quality wood
and
expert craftsmanship
to make good tables.

I mark these tables with a
"ùïÑ"
mark.
People know that this mark means it is a table
made with high quality wood and expert craftsmanship.

Even if I never make chairs,
if someone was to make chairs and mark them with
"ùïÑ"
it would be reasonable for consumers to assume I made those.
If those chairs are shoddily made,
this reflects on my tables and their brand.

This is what trademarks cover.
This is why
"fields of endeavors"
is a vague boundary.

What if someone makes,
say,
shirts?
Is that close enough to tables?

The answer should be obvious:
*I don't know*.
This would be a matter for courts to decide
if confusion is likely and what liability is there.

Trademark law,
and trademark enforcement,
are complicated by necessity.
This is an unfortunate truth.

As in any such complicated law
we should be ready for both kinds of mistakes:
false enforcements
and
missing enforcements.

A
"false enforcements"
is a case where a trademark violation
should have been decided for the good of society.
A
"missing enforcement"
is a case where a trademark violation
was decided
to the detriment of society.

That these happen
*is not a knock against trademark law in general*.
This is not a defense of trademark law either!

It is possible that trademark law should be amended.
Amending the law,
ideally,
would reduce both kinds of errors.

More typically,
it would reduce one in favor of the other.
Whether this is a good idea is a complicated decision.

All of these things are important to keep in mind when
evaluating the law,
as well as the outcome of various cases.
It is too easy to rush to conclusions and make the law worse.

Patents
-------

It is important to understand the original intent of patent law.
The context in which patents were invented was that
people would take knowledge
*to their graves*
to protect it.

The goal of patent law is to give people an incentive to invent
secret techniques
and publish them.
In return for publishing the technique
they receive exclusivity for some time.

The first trade-off in patent law
is
how strict to be about
the notions of
*secret technique*
and
*publish*.
People will publish as little about the technique,
and as confusingly as they can get away with.

One of the goals of the patent office is to verify that the
"publishing"
is clear enough.
It is not unlikely that the current standards are too low.

The other goal of the patent office is to verify that what is described is,
indeed,
a secret technique.
It is not unlikely that the current standards are too low.

However,
it is important to note that here,
too,
there are trade-offs.
Making the standards too strict would either reduce inventions of
new techniques
or
keeping them as trade secrets forever.

Copyright
---------

Last,
but certainly not least,
we come to copyright.

Copyright was invented as a way to force
companies who owned machines which could copy
books
to pay the people who wrote
books.
The two common ways of paying people for books are
"work for hire"
and
"buying a license".

Buying licenses is a complicated topic of contract law,
the license can be exclusive,
time-bound,
both,
or neither,
among other things.
Works for hire is simpler:
where it applies,
the company owns the copyright
in return for paying the author in advance.

After copying other things,
like music
or video media,
became easier,
copyright law grew to apply to those as well.
By now,
copyright
"maximalism"
attaches copyright to any
"creative work".

By now,
what copyright covers
and
who owns it are mostly a matter of consensus.
However,
there are still degrees of freedom in the law:

* What copying acts fall under the law?
* How long does copyright last for?

The first question is the
"fair use exemption".
Currently,
fair use is limited both by law and precendent.
One potential way to amend copyright law
is to increase what the exemption covers.

The second question got the most
political will applied to it.
For example,
the
`Term Extension Act`_
faced
both political and legal opposition.

.. _Term Extension Act: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act

It is important to note though that,
for example,
"Steamboat Willie"
is
*not*
the modern Micky Mouse.
If someone tried to derive something from
Steamboat Willie,
how influenced would they need to be from modern Mickey Mouse
before it violated the copyright act?

This is,
in many ways,
a question of what falls under
"fair use".

It is widely accepted that,
as it stands,
copyright law does not make
trade-offs
that are optimal for society.
It is also reflecting,
by extension,
on general IP law.

The fact that the legislative branch has been
so captured by corporate interests
casts doubt on whether the trade-offs
in the rest of the related laws are designed for scietal benefits.
If for no other reason,
it would be good to amend copyright law to be less restrictive.

Summary
-------

As a category,
"IP law"
is not a coherent one.
However,
as an alignment of corporate interests,
many of these laws are sponsored by similar financial interests.
