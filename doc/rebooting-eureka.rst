Rebooting Eureka
================

I'm rewatching
[Eureka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28American_TV_series%29).
I was reminded of two things:

* I love this show. It's a good show.
* The show does
  *not*
  love autistic people.
  This is a huge flaw that makes it hard
  to enjoy it at times.

Apparently there's a bit of drama around the season 5 cancellation
and how it was not wrapped up properly with a season 6 miniseries
because
SyFy
considered it
"too expensive".

The show probably won't
"come back".
But this means that a reboot might make sense.

Here is a suggested reboot.
It has several premises:

* Disney+ acquires the rights.
  Monetizing soft sci-fi nostalgia
  would be right up its alley.
* We want something compatible with
  2023
  sensibilities.

With this in mind,
here's a pitch for a rebooted pilot.

A divorced
US
marshall
and his
teen daughter are following their
GPS.
When the GPS goes on the fritz,
the dad pulls out a paper map
to figure out the rest of the drive.

It is night,
raining,
and
his daughter is being a pain.
He misses the exit.

The road becomes narrow.
The highway ended.

Something weird on the road causes him to veer off.
When he and his daughter comes to,
they are being pulled out of the car by the sherrif,
Jo Lupo.

The car will need some fixing.
The only town for miles around is Eureka,
where they are offered temporary accomodations.
Henry Deacon,
still played by a Black actor,
is the
"mechanic as a hobby."

Slowly,
through discussions,
we find the following out
during the A plot
with Carter:

* The reason the marshall was driving with his daughter
  was that she ran away from her mom.
  He was returning her.
  She doesn't get along with the mom's boyfriend,
  and wants to live with her dad.
* Sheriff Lupo lost her deputy recently to some
  unexplained accident.
* Eureka's Global Dynamics does some weird research.

Lupo suspects that whatever drove Carter off of the road
had something to do with what happened to her deputy.
She interrogates him,
but offers little in return to his questions.

When Carter meets with Henry to check on his car,
he gets more details.
The deputy died at the exact time the car was
driven off of the road,
and Carter's watch stopped.

Carter puts things together.
The deputy was a robot,
unbeknown to anyone.
No autopsy was made,
because he burned to a crisp.

The B plot focuses on Zoe.
She has a large breakfast at
Cafe Diem
when she learns it's free.

A girl joins her table.
They realize they have more in common than they thought:
the daughter,
too,
confesses that she wanted to run away from her mom.

The daughter has an uncanny knack for technology.
Zoe eventually realizes that she did run away last night,
but something made her go back.

The
A
and
B
plots merge
when Carter talks to Zoe,
and realizes that the daughter
running away from home
also coincided with the time everything happened.

The daughter figured out deputy Andy was a robot.
She deactivated him,
only to trigger a fail-safe that effected the car
and Carter's watch.
The machines in Eureka all have EMP-shielding,
which is why they weren't affected.
This is why the daughter ran back.

As a result:

* Lupo offers Carter to be a deputy.
* Zoe says that she made a friend,
  and would love to stay in Eureka.
* Carter calls his ex,
  and they agree that Zoe can stay with him
  if he takes the deputy job.

The
artifact
and
Kevin
plot needs to be revisited.
It is hard to find a reasonably sensitive option.

Since the main plot reason for it
is to give
Ally
a moral dilemma,
have the artifact connect with her directly.
The reason she's the liaison
is that she's a great scientist,
but not Eureka-level.
The Artifact boosts her ability to do science
and make discoveries.
