Fictional Politics
==================

Fictional universes can have
devoted following.
People of all demographics
end up being fans.

Political alliances,
especially as they relate to demographics can shift and change.
Fictional universes,
with modern IP law,
can stay under a single owner
for a long time.

However,
this does not mean those fictional universes are do not have
clear political messages.
The people who manage the IP
are sometimes blamed for not being
"politically neutral".
However,
those people,
if they manage the IP
with any sort of authenticity,
cannot manage it neutrally.

Marvel Cinematic Universe
-------------------------

The
Marvel Cinematic Universe
(MCU)
is the latest reimagining
of the original
Marvel Comic-Book Universe.

Marvel has always made it clear that most of their comic books happen in the same universe
(616).
There have been other famous universes
(the
Ultimate universe,
the
OG Spider-Girl Universe from the early 2000,
and more),
but those were always offshoots.

Captain America,
one of the earliest titles,
precedes the
*name*
Marvel comics
as well as the entry of the US
into
World War II.
At that point in US politics,
the official US position was neutrality about the war in Europe.

Captain America
fighting
Nazis
was not just an
abstract
political statement,
in the sense that all statements about what a country should do are political.
At the time,
it was a
*controversial*
political statement.

Originally,
the X-men
were not invented as a political statement,
but as a way to avoid inventing ad-hoc origin stories:
"mutant"
was all the justification
Stan Lee needed
for any superpowers he wanted.
Shortly into the X-men series,
however,
it started exploring issues of bigotry and prejudice.

Marvel is not some magical
pro-LGBT pro-civil-rights
entity.
It is a commerical company that tried to make money,
went bankrupt,
got acquired by private equity,
and flipped to be resold to Disney+ for a nice profit.

However,
from the beginning,
Marvel took a clear position on politics.
Stories depicted characters fighting against
white supremacism,
racism,
homophobia,
and
anti-semitism.

The 20th century had many political entities
struggle with many issues
of equal rights and inclusion
for people of different
races,
religions,
sexual orientations,
gender identities,
and more.
Marvel has been writing stories throughout that time.

Not all of the stories have been written in the most sensitive way.
But throughout,
the stories have shown a clear theme.

Marvel stories are not politicallly neutral.
The
MCU
has kept the same political theme.

It is to Disney's credit,
not blame,
that they still uphold the same themes.
Upholding adherance to the
ethical and political principles
behind the
MCU
from the people involved
is consistent with this.

Star Wars Canon
---------------

The Star Wars Canon
has been written and adjusted
many times.
The
original
Extended Universe,
for example,
has now been rebranded as
"Legends":
based on true stories,
but potentially with incorrect details.

The central part of the canon,
and enough for this analysis,
is the original trilogy:
Episodes IV, V, and VI.
(As an aside,
there are purists who reject even that,
as well as
the renaming of
Episode IV
to
"A New Hope",
and only consider the original
release of
Episode IV,
"Star Wars",
as canon.
This can be safely ignored.)

One of the first things that happens in
Episode IV
is that the Emperor
"disbands the Senate".
In context,
this seems to be the final confirmation that a
once-democratic system
no longer even considers the pretense of
democracy
to be useful.

The rebels,
then,
are fighting to overthrow an illegitimate leader.
It is safe to assume that,
as these things usually go,
the
Emperor rose to power originally by being elected
and then started dismantling those institutions
which would keep checks and balances on him.

This kind of dynamic has happened in real life often enough.
Hungary
and
Turkey
are just two recent examples.

The movies are told from the perspective of the rebels
overthrowing the empire.
The Jedi are the good guys working to protect people.

Recently,
prominent GOP leaders have
praised Hungary as an example
of
"good leadership".
Princess Lei,
Han Solo,
and
Luke Skywalker
would disagree.

Expecting the Star Wars franchise to be politically neutral is not reasonable.
It is built around specific political statements for how to organize political entities.

Once again,
Disney should be lauded for keeping those political themes
authentic to the original stories.
Upholding the people involved in creating these stories
to these ethical standards
is consistent.

Summary
-------

Disney is a corporation,
designed to maximize profits.
Much of their business model could be described as
"monetizing nostalgia".

Because of that,
as an organization that manages valuable IP,
Disney respects the integrity of that IP.
This integrity is crucial
for the nostalgia to be properly monetized.

When the original themes include
stories with political aspects
the modern re-tellings and sequels
keep the those same aspects,
to keep the nostalgia alive.
In protecting these aspects,
Disney is clear with the people involved
with the modern takes on the stories
that their public persona should be
compatible
with the stories.

This is no less reasonable
than a political party
firing a spokesperson
if they publically make statement
incompatible with the party's positions.
