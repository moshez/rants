Dr. Strange Should Not Bow
==========================

(Or: Who is the Sorcerer Supreme)

Warning:
Minor spoilers for
Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness.

Let's get the spoilers out of the way first:
when Strange first meets Wong in the movie,
he does not bow.
Wong remarks that it is
"tradition"
to bow to the Sorcerer Supreme.

Later on,
others do bow to Wong.
He rolls his eyes at
Strange,
and remarks that they have
properly observed
the
"tradition".

Did Dr. Strange violate tradition?
Is he so bitter about losing the position of the
Sorcerer Supreme
that he will not acknowledge Wong's?

Maybe not.

Who is the
Sorcerer Supreme?
By tradition,
the Sorcer Supreme
is the one who controls the
Eye of Agammoto,
or the
Time Stone.

The stone is no longer.
Though it exists in some technical sense,
it has been scattered.

Wong is not,
properly speaking,
the Sorcerer Supreme.
At best,
he is a sort of
"Acting Sorcerer Supreme".

Wong is responsible for the
non-Time-stone specific
duties that,
traditionally,
the Sorcerer Supreme
used to be responsible for.
This is appropriate,
since he would have been
next in line to get
the stone,
had it not been destroyed.

Nonetheless,
that does not make him the
Sorcerer Supreme,
and does not,
necessarily,
afford him the dignities of the
title.
